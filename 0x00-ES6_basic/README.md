# JavaScript, the core language (ECMAScript)

The core language of JavaScript is standardized by the ECMA TC39 committee as a language named ECMAScript. "ECMAScript" is the term for the language standard, but "ECMAScript" and "JavaScript" can be used interchangeably.

# Among other things, ECMAScript defines:

Language syntax (parsing rules, keywords, control flow, object literal initialization, ...)
Error handling mechanisms (throw, try...catch, ability to create user-defined Error types)
Types (boolean, number, string, function, object, ...)
A prototype-based inheritance mechanism
Built-in objects and functions, including JSON, Math, Array methods, parseInt, decodeURI, etc.
Strict mode
A module system
Basic memory model

# 6th edition of ECMAScript (known as ES6)
ES6 is synonymous with ES2015
