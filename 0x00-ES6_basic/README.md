# JavaScript, the core language (ECMAScript)

The core language of JavaScript is standardized by the ECMA TC39 committee as a language named ECMAScript. "ECMAScript" is the term for the language standard, but "ECMAScript" and "JavaScript" can be used interchangeably.

# Among other things, ECMAScript defines:

Language syntax (parsing rules, keywords, control flow, object literal initialization, ...)
Error handling mechanisms (throw, try...catch, ability to create user-defined Error types)
Types (boolean, number, string, function, object, ...)
A prototype-based inheritance mechanism
Built-in objects and functions, including JSON, Math, Array methods, parseInt, decodeURI, etc.
Strict mode
A module system
Basic memory model

# 6th edition of ECMAScript (known as ES6)
ES6 is synonymous with ES2015

# JavaScript has 8 Datatypes
1. String
2. Number
3. Bigint
4. Boolean
5. Undefined
6. Null
7. Symbol
8. Object

Whereas HTML defines a webpage's structure and content and CSS sets the formatting and appearance, JavaScript adds interactivity to a webpage and creates rich web applications.

# JavaScript typed arrays
JavaScript typed arrays are array-like objects that provide a mechanism for reading and writing raw binary data in memory buffers

# Spread syntax (...)
Spread syntax looks exactly like rest syntax. In a way, spread syntax is the opposite of rest syntax. Spread syntax "expands" an array into its elements, while rest syntax collects multiple elements and "condenses" them into a single element.

# Strict inequality (!==)
The strict inequality (!==) operator checks whether its two operands are not equal, returning a Boolean result. Unlike the inequality operator, the strict inequality operator always considers operands of different types to be different.

x !== y
!(x === y);

# Strict equality (===)
The strict equality (===) operator checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result. Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be different.
